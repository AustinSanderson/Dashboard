Sample Population:

The Office of Management and Budget defines a Metropolitan Division (MD) as a county, or group of counties, within a Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) that has a population core of at least 2.5 million. While an MD is a subdivision of a larger MSA, it “often functions as a distinct social, economic, and cultural area within the larger region” (Office of Management and Budget 2020). For the above reason, we have chosen MDs as our sample population; it is representative of distinct social areas for our study. There are 11 MSAs containing 31 MDs that are then subdivided into 110 counties.

Note: Some county-level exclusions were made in this data set as it was merged with another data set on incarceration.
